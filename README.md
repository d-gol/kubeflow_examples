# Kubeflow Examples

A repository with examples to run on Kubeflow at *ml.cern.ch*.
This repository contains basic examples to get on board with using Kubeflow and its various components.
The idea is that examples from here run out-of-the-box.

The explaination and instructions how to run the examples are below.
If all the examples run as suggested here, you can be sure that Kubeflow cluster is stable.
If some of the examples fail to run, please get in touch to *dejan.golubovic@cern.ch*
